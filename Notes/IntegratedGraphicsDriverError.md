__Keywords__: Integrated Graphics; Driver; Issue; Solved

During running a graphics/memory intensive program, the system often crashes with the display connected to the integrated graphics loss of signal. Suspect yet another driver issue with integrated graphics. The hardware configuration is discussed in [another post.](IntegratedGraphicsDisplayConnectError.md)

This problem seems to be a driver issue. Uninstalled integrated graphics driver (previously installed by USB stick that came with the motherboard/'automatic' install) and reinstalled from Intel's website. Have not observed similar issue though 5 days upon installing the new driver
